Vortex is a rev-sharing token launcher platform designed to simplify the launch of ERC20 tokens by providing first-block initial liquidity lending on EVM-compatible blockchains. With Vortex, users can create a token and have it instantly live and tradable on Uniswap with initial liquidity provided by stakers, with 2 clicks.

## Features
